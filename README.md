## Basic Details
### Team Name: JINX (Individual)


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Albin V Abraham - ICCS COLLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT

### Project Description
This project is a collection of playful, pointless web calculators designed to provide humorous answers to absurd questions. It takes a user's physical details like age, height, and weight to calculate things nobody has ever asked for, such as how many birthday candles could be made from their body fat or how much saliva they produce in a year.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
I am trying to give a useless answer to useless info

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I was just making a solution which popped in my head as i was procrasinating while laying on my bed, I am giving a answer for a pointless question by taking the physical measurements of the user

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

- **CSS3**: For all styling, including layouts, colors, and animations (gradients, sliding cards, confetti).
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For all interactivity, including the one-at-a-time question logic and calculations.
- **VS Code**: As the primary code editor.

### Implementation
This project is built with standard web technologies and requires no special installation or build steps. All code is self-contained within the HTML files.

For Software:
# Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the `.html` files in any modern web browser.
